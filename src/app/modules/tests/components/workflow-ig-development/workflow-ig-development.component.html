        On this page, select the "Submit/View Documentation" button on the bottom. This will open up a pop-up window for your
        file upload. Select your mapping spreadsheet file as an XLS/XLSX, and then press the "Upload" button. (If you need support
        for other formats, you may provide them in a Zip file.)
      </li>
      <li>
        This should change the status for the validation test to "review pending" in the bottom right corner of this screen. You may now return to the event listing.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you need to submit a new mapping spreadsheet, you may do so by following the process again. This will overwrite your previous submission if the file names are the same,
        so if you wish to keep a record of your submissions you must uniquely name your files.
