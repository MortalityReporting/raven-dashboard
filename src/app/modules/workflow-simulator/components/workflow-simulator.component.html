          The 'EDRS Search' workflow simulates searching cases in an Electronic Death Registration System (EDRS).
          Testers
          representing Medical Examiners/Coroners (ME/Cs) can provide search parameters executed against the BlueJay
          EDRS
          test server, which implements the MDI Documents FHIR Operation for search. Supported parameters include
          primary
          case identification fields, as well as additional data (e.g., demographics information) if it exists in
          the test
          EDRS case records. Search parameters and all relevant HTTP requests and responses are provided in both
          human
          readable forms and as FHIR resources for demonstration.
